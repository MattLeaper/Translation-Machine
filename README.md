This repository contains the Python code and the final thesis for my undergraduate project: a fully functional web-based translator. The project demonstrates the integration of machine learning models for language translation within a web application framework.

Features

Web-based interface for language translation.

Integration of custom-trained language models.

User-friendly design to input and receive translated text.
